pam-pgsql (0.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The default setting for pw_type has been changed from clear to sha1. This
  change will break setups that previously used pam-pgsql < 0.7.1 where no
  pw_type has been specified and another configuration file then
  /etc/pam_pgsql.conf is used. The postinst script will set pw_type = clear
  explicitly if you are upgrading from a version less than 0.7.1 and your
  system's setup uses /etc/pam_pgsql.conf.  You are encouraged to change your
  setup to use a more secure mechanism (i.e. sha1) and to change your database
  accordingly though.
